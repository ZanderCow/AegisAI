# AegisAI

This is the top-level README file for the AegisAI project.

## Recommended Workflow

The AegisAI project is structured into separate modules for the backend and frontend. To ensure the most efficient development experience and optimal performance from AI agents, please follow this workflow:

1.  **Backend Development:** Open the `backend/` folder in a new window. Use AI agents within that specific window for backend tasks.
2.  **Frontend Development:** Open the `frontend/aegisai/` folder in a separate window. Use AI agents within that specific window for frontend tasks.

Instead of running everything from this main project root, this setup allows agents to have better context and focus on the specific domain of each part of the application.
